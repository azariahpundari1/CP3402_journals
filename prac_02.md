# Week 3, Learning journal 2

## Learning Activities

This week I setup up my joomla! content management system (CMS) for my website. Insted of doing it locally, I used the joomla cloud access to webhost - this also provided plugins that essentially enabled me to use templates and dynamically edit the templates without using code.

I tried to learn and understand the basics of navigating joomla's dashboard, installing plugins, installing templates onto joomla and editing a web page (artical - in terms of joomla) using joomla. This helped me differentiate between the menu and content aspect of joomla and I think its essential to understand what they do for future reference. I also learned that you always have to save an article or a menu in order for it to work - or else you will be greeted with a 404 page.

I've also learnt about a nicepage. This introduced me to plugins, how to install plugins and templates. Nicepage is also great for building your own custom template thats responsive and saved me a lot of time.

I first tried to setup a local development, however the tutorials I used as reference where outdated. But, I did learn how to use homebrew to install packages in which case I installed mySQL, apache, php and XAMPP - I am assuming I'll need to use them for the assignment.

## Estimated Hours

This week, I spent around 6 hours on this practical alone.

## Content Insights

Joomla was quite hard to understand at first and I wouldn't say its the best introduction to CMS, for me personally. The default templates provided by joomla look outdated, however the plugins provided provide a variety of templates to use and edit - it also allows developers to design a custom template from scratch. This felt like a big step for me from having known nothing about CMS to diving into the deep end of joomla but I absolutely loved overcoming each obstacle with trial and error. I learned that you create menues and link them to the articles you have created, however I am still yet to wrap my head around navigation links.

The best part about this was namepage like brrrruuuuuuuh, we can edit a webpage without code on a seperate page, since when was this even a thing?!?!?!?! I dont think I would not have finished this practical if it weren't for this.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Joomla is a free open source web development and CMS platform. As joomla is the second most used CMS (word press being the first) I believe joomla wont be dying out in the near future hence I am more then likely to be using it. From my short experience, joomla is relatively good for the front-end and back-end aspect of web development so I do plan on using this in the future if I get into web development as my career of choice - mostly because it gets easier to use after playing around with it. Sadly, we havent covered much of the back-end side yet but I am keen on learning more about how to integrate the front and back-end together.  

For employability, I dont think companies will hire someone who doesn't know how to use the resources (CMS) that are already available and not effectively show that I can maintain a steady workflow. The steps I can take now to improve are:

1. Learn more & nderstand each individual components of joomla - especially the links/expired links and relinking (this stopped work flow for a while)
2. Learn how to manually create articles/categories and menus instead of using a template - I think this is a core principle that must be learnt completely (assuming its similar to other CMS's).
3. Slow down and stop being anxious - progress can be slow sometimes, as long as you're moving forward thats a win.
