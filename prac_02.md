# Week 3, Learning journal 2

## Learning Activities

This week I setup up my joomla! content management system for my website. Insted of doing it locally, I used the joomla cloud access to webhost - this also provided plugins that essentially enabled me to use templates and dynamically edit the templates without using code.

I tried to learn and understand the basics of navigating joomla's dashboard, installing plugins, installing templates onto joomla and editing a web page (artical - in terms of joomla) using joomla. This helped me differentiate between the menu and content aspect of joomla and I think its essential to understand what they do for future reference.

I've also learnt about a nicepage. This introduced me to plugins, how to install plugins and templates. Nicepage is also great for building your own custom template thats responsive and saved me a lot of time.

I first tried to setup a local development, however the tutorials I used as reference where outdated. But, I did learn how to use homebrew to install packages.

## Estimated Hours

This week, I spent around 6 hours on this practical alone.
