# Week 2, Learning journal 1

## Learning Activities

This week I mainly focused on the HTML aspect of the assignment, I did however read through the bootstrap docs to gain a basic understanding of how to use bootstrap, bootstrap templates and to integrate bootstraps css into my HTML.

(career) I found reading the bootstrap docs to be helpful and all IT organziations or anything to do with programming to web apps will have their docs to read through. It is good practice to get into the habit to read the docs.

I relearned how to use Git and Github to keep my journal entries up to date. I find it easier to read the docs, although videos where given, but personally it is easier for me to 'read and practice' - This keeps me alert at all times.

I had to refresh my memory on CSS and how its used for styling HTML. I covered basic classes, ids, syntaxes and units.

(career) I found it easier to use frameworks as opposed to redifining the wheel. However, I find that playing around with the built in classes helps me gain an understanding on what they change in the HTML file.

## Estimated hours
I spent around 7 hours on this practical - only this practical and not actual subject work.

## Content Insights
Bootstrap is a CSS framework that comes with templates. It allows easier responsive web design and built in CSS classes.

If I hadn't used bootstrap, a lot of time would have been spent on making the basic website responsive - starting from mobile view to desktop view. A lot of time will also be spent on desiging each individual page from scratch with wireframes etc. However, with Bootstrap, it simplified it down to just understanding what the css classes would do and using them in the right places. This is time efficient and a lot of energy is best spent on learning as opposed to having mental breakdowns.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Most web developers generally use frameworks as it's much more efficient. The use of templates is ideal as not all web developers are designers - hence this ideal for solo developers working on personal projects to commisions.

I think I will be using this a lot in the future as I love web development (front end development). I will definitely be reading through bootstrap docs and watching tutorials here and there to upskill to ensure im job ready.

I am glad this subject got us to read through bootstrap :).
