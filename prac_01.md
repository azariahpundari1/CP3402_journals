# Week 2, prac 01

## Learning Activities
This week I mainly focused on the HTML aspect of the assignment, I did however read through the bootstrap docs to gain a basic understanding of how to use bootstrap, bootstrap templates and to integrate bootstraps css into my HTML.

(career) I found reading the bootstrap docs to be helpful and all IT organziations or anything to do with programming to web apps will have their docs to read through. It is good practice to get into the habit to read the docs.

I relearned how to use Git and Github to keep my journal entries up to date. I find it easier to read the docs, although videos where given, but personally it is easier for me to 'read and practice' - This keeps me alert at all times.

I had to refresh my memory on CSS and how its used for styling HTML. I covered basic classes, ids, syntaxes and units.

(career) I found it easier to use frameworks as opposed to redifining the wheel. However, I find that playing around with the built in classes helps me gain an understanding on what they change in the HTML file.

## Estimated hours
I spent around 7 hours on this practical - only this practical and not actual subject work.
